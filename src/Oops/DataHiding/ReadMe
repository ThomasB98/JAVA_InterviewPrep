outside person can access our internal data directly
or our internal data should not go out directly this oop
is nothing but Data Hiding

after validation or authentication outside person can access
our internal data for example:
    1.After providing proper user name and password
    we can able to access our gmail inbox information
    2.even though we are valid customer of bank
    we can able to access our account information and
    we can't access other account information

to achieve dataHiding use private keyword for
every data item
